## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this project was to create a high-performance, responsive entry point that effectively communicates my "Triple Threat" skill set. It directs recruiters and clients to my specific domains:
* **Engineering:** Full-stack applications and logic.
* **Documentation:** API references and user manuals.
* **Localization:** Professional translation and subtitling samples.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN), JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Design:** Mobile-first responsive grid system.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
* **Icons:** Lucide-react / FontAwesome for visual navigation.

## 📁 Key Navigation Points
| Section | Destination | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Docs** | [Docsify Hub] | Showcases technical writing & i18n standards. |
| **Admin Portal** | [GitHub Repo] | Showcases PHP (CI4) & Database management. |
| **Translations** | [Smartcat] | Showcases 10+ years of EN-ID expertise. |

## 🏗️ Architecture
This landing page uses a modern **Component-based CSS** approach via Tailwind. By leveraging a utility-first framework, I ensured the site is lightweight and achieves a near-perfect Google Lighthouse performance score.
